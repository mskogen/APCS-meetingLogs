CSCI 3308 Project - BlizzardKicker

-- Decisions -- 
-Call API about every 30 min or so.
-user login as URL/$USER_ID
-Landing page for website unless user is already logged in
-Login page as popup instead of as a whole separate page
-Registration -> username, email, set preferences, and maybe picture
-sliders for preferences and dropdowns for season passes
-results page discribes algorithm/selection reasoning for chosen resort

-- WHAT DID YOU DO? --

All: Recapped milestone 3 meetings and plans for moving forward based on feedback.

Ryan Davis: Work on the homepage

Matthew Skogen: work on making the login page a popup and help with landing page
